Text Adventure Game for MSCH-C220 FA20

Go in any direction by using the commands "Go " + a cardinal direction. If it's any direction the game will tell you, and will tell you otherwise if it is not. 

I didn't have time to incorporate audio, deciding to hold that for the space shooter. Please let me know if you enjoyed this text adventure, or if came across as pretentious or something.

Thanks for Playing
